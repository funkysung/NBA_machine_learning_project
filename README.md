Group project for DATASCI3000, by Endreas Yohannes, Dexter Yan, Sung Hyun Kim and Justin Lai

## Install

- Unzip nba.sqlite.zip and move the resulting nba.sqlite file into the same directory as the notebook
- Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run the notebook

## Notes

A workaround was needed to get the sqlite file into the repo due to GitHub's size requirements (nothing against GitHub's policy, we just had to use Git LFS). On the off chance that the sqlite file is inaccessible:

- Go to the [Kaggle database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball?resource=download)
- Scroll down to the table titled "nba.sqlite (2.35GB)" 
- You should see a download icon in the upper right corner of the table. Click that to download the sqlite file
- Follow the remaining install instructions as normal
